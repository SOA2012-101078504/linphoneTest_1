Android tutorials
====================

Tutorials are written in Kotlin, but the same features can be achieved in Java.

Tutorials are numbered 0 to 6, and we recommend you to read them in that order as features from previous tutorials are used in the next ones, such as account login.

Each tutorial is a full project, so you can import it in Android Studio, build it and deploy it on a real device or an emulator.

Code is being kept as short and simple as possible, and comments explain how and why things are being done. 
You can focus on the Activity and build.gradle files, the rest being projects / UI files.

Full Java API is available [here](http://linphone.org/snapshots/docs/liblinphone/latest/java).
