Advanced chat tutorial
====================

This tutorial will demonstrate how to leverage on our own SIP server named [Flexisip](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/flexisip) and it's conference server to create group chats, use end-to-end encryption and send ephemeral messages.

If you don't have deployed a flexisip server yet, you can create & use a free SIP account using our [free SIP service](https://subscribe.linphone.org/).
