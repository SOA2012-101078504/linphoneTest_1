## Android

Even though Linphone's APIs are available in Java, Android tutorials have been created in Kotlin as it is the current standard for Android apps.

Linphone-SDK will be downloaded automatically by gradle from our [Maven repository](https://linphone.org/maven_repository/org/linphone/linphone-sdk-android/).

## iOS

In the same way, iOS tutorials are written in Swift but the same can be achieved through Objective-C.

Linphone-SDK binaries are fetched from our [Cocoapods repository](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/podspec.git) for iOS.

## Desktop

Desktop tutorials are in C#, leveraging on our Nuget packaging.

## Additional resources
