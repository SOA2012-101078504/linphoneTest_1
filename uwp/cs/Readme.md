Linphone X UWP tutorial
=======================

Welcome to the C# tutorial, we are going to learn how to use the LinphoneSDK in the UWP (Universal Windows Platform) environment.

We recommend you to use Visual Studio 2019 to follow this tutorial. 

First of all you can open the TutorialsCS solution in Visual Studio (TutorialsCS.sln) .
Under the solution you will find several projects, each is a step from a hello world to a nearly full communication app using LinphoneSDK. 
Each step work and can be run independently, and in each step the new "Linphone" code is explained.

Don't forget to get a look at [Liblinphone doc](https://linphone.org/releases/docs/liblinphone/5.0/cs/) to see the complete list of available APIs.

You can find a readme file in each project, explaining the project goal and how to run and understand it.
